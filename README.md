A data science project for DSC80 course in UCSD

## Introduction

League of Legend is the largest esport game in the world, and the dataset I'm using contains esports match data from the 2022 season of League of Legends. The primary goal of this project is to explore whether there are differences in performance across different professional leagues and player positions. Analyzing pro play data like this is crucial for pro play teams to develop winning strategies and  identify high-performing players. I want to see how various factors influence success in the game, and Iâ€™m particularly eager to dive into this analysis because I'm an experienced League of Legends player who has followed pro play for years.
