# League of Legends Pro Games Analysis
by Jayden Huang
A data science project for DSC80 course in UCSD

## Introduction

League of Legend is the largest esport game in the world,, and the dataset I'm using contains esports match data from the 2022 season of League of Legends. The primary goal of this project is to explore whether there are differences in performance across different professional leagues and player positions. Analyzing this pro play data like this is crucial for pro play teams to understand winning strategies and player performance metrics. I'm want to see how different factors influence success in the game and I'm excited to try this analysis out for myself.
